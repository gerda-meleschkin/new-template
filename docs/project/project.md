# Whats my fight

Connection and community, that´s my fight. This pictures shows on the one hand the mother earth with plants and animals and on the other hand the human life. I think it’s really important that we don’t lose the connection between the nature and ourselves. We are all together on the same planet and now see what problems we get when we act separately. Global warming, air pollution and world hunger for example are problems which comes from not connecting which each other. The world is full of products and trash caused from humans. I think it’s important now to think more about what we have, what we really need and what we can recycle. Acting more together instead of separately.
